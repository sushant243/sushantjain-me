This week marks the beginning of my journey building Lessgo.ai in public. It's both exciting and terrifying to share the raw, unfiltered process of building a startup.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public isn't just about transparency - it's about accountability. When you share your progress, challenges, and learnings openly, you create a feedback loop that accelerates learning.

## This Week's Progress

### Technical Foundation
- Set up the core infrastructure using Next.js and Rust
- Implemented basic authentication system
- Created the initial API architecture

### Customer Discovery
- Conducted 5 user interviews with potential customers
- Identified 3 key pain points in current developer workflows
- Refined our value proposition based on feedback

## Challenges Faced

The biggest challenge this week was balancing speed with quality. As a solo founder initially, every decision carries weight. Do I build it perfectly or ship it quickly?

I chose to ship quickly and iterate based on feedback.

## Key Learnings

1. **Talk to users early and often** - My assumptions were wrong about what features mattered most
2. **Ship small, ship often** - Momentum matters more than perfection
3. **Document everything** - Your future self will thank you

## What's Next?

Next week, I'm focusing on:
- Building the MVP's core feature
- Onboarding 5 beta users
- Setting up analytics to track usage patterns

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This is step one.

Follow along as I build Lessgo.ai from zero to (hopefully) something meaningful.
