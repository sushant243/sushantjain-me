[Day 12] - "He Said Yes, Then Ghosted Me"

Yesterday I wrote about the hot lead who loved the demo.

Today? Crickets.

I sent a follow-up. Nothing. Checked LinkedIn—he's active, posting memes. 

So I did what my B2B sales brain told me: I called him.

"Hey man, just being direct—did I lose you? What happened?"

Turns out: his boss shut it down. Budget freeze. He was embarrassed to tell me.

Here's the thing: in 14 years of sales, I've learned ghosting is rarely about you. It's about them. But you have to ASK to find out.

The real lesson? I'm going after solopreneurs and small teams, but this guy had to get boss approval. Wrong target. I'm moving down the ladder, not up.

Tomorrow: Back to talking to founders who control their own budgets.
