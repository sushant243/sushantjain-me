## **SECTION 1: OPENING FRAME**

### Page Title (H1):
```
Life Mastery Academy: The Course I Built Before I Understood Marketing
```

### Copy:
```
In 2017, I spent months creating this 10-module video course on personal transformation.

The production quality? Professional. I hired a crew, rented a studio, scripted everything. Cost me around €50K.

The problem? I had no idea who it was for or how to reach them. I built it because I thought a good product would sell itself.

It didn't. I never launched it publicly.

Eight years later, I'm making it available - not because it's my best work, but because it shows exactly what I got wrong: I optimized for production quality instead of audience clarity. I created content I wanted to make, not content people were asking for. I assumed "build it and they will come."

The irony? The course content on transformation and goal-setting is solid. But I couldn't transform it into a business because I didn't understand marketing.

Now I'm rebuilding from scratch with Lessgo.ai - this time, marketing first.

## **SECTION 2: THE VIDEOS**

### Optional Mini-Headline (above grid):
```
All 10 Modules
```

OR just start the grid with no headline. Your call.

### Layout:
- 2-column grid on desktop
- 1-column stack on mobile
- Each video shows:
  - Embedded YouTube player
  - Video title below (or above) player: "Module 1: Success Is For Everyone"

That's it. No extra text per video.

---

## **SECTION 3: CLOSING + CTA**

### Copy:
```
A polished course with no audience is just expensive self-expression.

I spent €50K on production. €0 on validating if anyone wanted this.

With Lessgo.ai, I'm doing the opposite - 72 people on the waitlist before writing a single line of code. That's the difference between building something and building something people will pay for.
