## **I've Been Trying to Crack This for 14 Years. Now I'm All In.**

Hey, I'm Sushant Jain.

For 14 years, I had a comfortable tech career:

* First 7 years: Software developer  
* Last 7 years: B2B sales (closed €600M+ in enterprise deals)

But the whole time, I was building on the side.

Internet marketing projects. Ecommerce stores. Startups. Side hustles. Some made a little money. Most went nowhere.

I kept thinking: *"If I just had more time... if I could just focus full-time... then I'd figure it out."*

In April 2025, I finally called my own bluff. I quit with 18 months of runway.

**Now I have no excuses. Just one question:**

Can 14 years of dev, sales, and failed side projects finally add up to one profitable B2B SaaS?

## **The Hypothesis I'm Testing**

After 14 years of trying, I've noticed something:

Most projects fail because founders fail to market. Some because of lack of knowledge, some because of lack of interest.

And there is a lot of misinformation in the "marketing first" approach. Most people think it means posting on Twitter and getting waitlist signups. That's not marketing. That's content.

I've closed €600M+ in B2B sales. Real marketing means finding people already paying for bad solutions and confirming they'll switch to yours.

**I'm testing a systematic approach to go from early adopters to enterprise customers** \- the kind of path that actually works when you're bootstrapping B2B SaaS.

And I'm documenting every step.

## **This Is For You If:**

✓ You've tried building things before (maybe they didn't work out)  
✓ You're building now or about to start  
✓ You want to learn the real marketing-first approach, not "build and pray"  
✓ You value watching someone with real experience figure this out in real-time

## **This Is NOT For You If:**

✗ You need a proven step-by-step system (I'm testing one, not teaching one... yet)  
✗ You want only highlight reels (you'll see the failures too)  
✗ You're already past $10K MRR (you're ahead of where I am)

## **What You'll Get**

One email every Thursday. 5-minute read.

Real experiments. Real conversations with customers. Real results (good and bad).

**Recent topics:**

* "How I got 72 waitlist signups before writing code"  
* "Why I'm building case studies at $0 MRR"  
* "What 7 years of closing enterprise deals taught me about early-stage positioning"  
* "The side project mistakes I made for 14 years (and what I'm doing differently now)"

This isn't a course. It's field notes from someone who's been in the trenches for 14 years, finally going all-in.

**P.S.** — After 14 years of side projects and a corporate career, I quit in April 2025 with 18 months of runway. If this works, I'll have cracked what I've been chasing for over a decade. If it doesn't, you'll learn what NOT to do. Either way, you get the real story.
